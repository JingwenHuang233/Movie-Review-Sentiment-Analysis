# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
The program is to use the provided data to develop an algorithm that will allow a user to input a new review and will automatically score the sentiment of the review.

The data that the algorithm is going to “learn” from is a set of 8,529 movie reviews in which the sentiment of each review has been manually rated on a scale from 0 to 4. The sentiment labels are:

  0 - Negative
  
  1 - Somewhat Negative
  
  2 - Neutral
  
  3 - Somewhat Positive
  
  4 - Positive
  
The program should prompt the user to input a movie review, and automatically score the review based on the average score of the words in the review.
